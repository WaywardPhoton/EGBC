    "1.Consider the separation between two rays, $r_1$ and $r_2$ in the image above. Their difference, $\\delta$ is roughly equal to $a sin\\theta$. We  also know that for constructive intereference, $\\delta$ must be an integer multiple $m$ of the wavelength. Writing this out:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ a sin\\theta = m\\lambda$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "   For very small angles, we can approximate $sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$. Therefore if we measure the separation in angle relative to the $m^{th}$ peak, we can determine the wavelength of the light: \n",
    "\n",
    " $$lambda= \\theta a/m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that the fringe spacing in general will be $\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\lambda/a$. Therefore, as the slit spacing increases, the angles between fringes become far more narrow. This can be seen by playing with the variable for slit spacing in the online simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.The pattern that arises out of thick double slits can be found by multiplying the pattern that arises from the thin (point source) double slits with that of a single thick slit, giving a modulated version of the original pattern explored in this experiment. This can be seen by changing the slit width in the simulation. \n",
