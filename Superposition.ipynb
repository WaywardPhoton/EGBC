    "### Orthonormality\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last exercise question, we discovered that the inner product or scalar product of two different quantum states, $ |0\\rangle $ or $|1\\rangle$   results in 0. This property of the quantum states is called orthogonality. Moreover, we realized that the inner product of two same quantum states, such as  $ |0\\rangle $ and  $ |0\\rangle $ , always results in 1. This property is called normality. Combining these two properties, gives us the most crucial characteristic of the quantum state vectors - orthonormality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum states $ |0\\rangle $ and $|1\\rangle$ are special vector states called basis vectors. What that means is that you can construct any quantum state by a combination (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication by a number) of these vectors. Moreover these basis vectors are *orthonormal*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Superposition \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen how to work with vectors, let's take a look at how superposition is expressed in this format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $ |0\\rangle $ and $|1\\rangle$ quantum states are easy to visualize (eg spin-up or spin-down) - similar to classical bits. Now we will see the real beauty of quantum mechanics manifested in the way we write more complex qubit states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ |0\\rangle $ and $|1\\rangle$ qubit states form basis vectors, it is possible to define a new qubit state which is a linear combination of the two. This means that any linear combination of $ |0\\rangle $ and $|1\\rangle$  gives rise to a different quantum state. Some examples of qubits formed by linear combination are:\n",
    "- $|q_1\\rangle \\;=\\; 0.6|0\\rangle +0.8|1\\rangle$\n",
    "- $|q_2\\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle$\n",
    "- $|q_3\\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|1\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear combination results in a completely new qubit state, and is called a *superposition*. Superposition is a quantum phenomenon. Unlike a classical mixture, a superposition implies inherent uncertainty in the measurement outcome of the state. We can also convert this into conventional vector form. For instance,  $|q_1\\rangle \\;=\\; 0.6|0\\rangle +0.8|1\\rangle$ can be written as $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\\\ 0.8 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quantum state to be valid, its vector representation must have a length of 1. This is often referred to as 'normalization'. \n",
    "We can see this by thinking of the state as a vector and applying Pythagoras' theorem, such that a state $a|0\\rangle+ b|0\\rangle$ will have $a^2+b^2=1$"

    "In fact, there's a very useful tool we can use to visualize states that appears often in documentation, called the Bloch sphere. This tool maps the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ to opposite poles of a sphere, like the north and south poles of a bar magnet (or the earth!). These states appear at opposite poles because they are opposed to each other: the zero, or $|0\\rangle$ state contains none of the $|1\\rangle$ state and vice versa. These vectors are at right angles on the cartesian plane, and are 180 degrees apart on the sphere. \n",

    "There are two other states of interest that we will be dealing with that are worth mentioning: you might have noticed the $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ states on the Bloch sphere. These are superpositions of the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states in equal parts: \n",

    "You'll notice that these are very similar: the only difference is  the minus sign instead of the plus sign. This is not something we need to worry about: we'll exlpore these state in an activity shortly. \n"
