    "Now that we understand how qubit states work, it's time to figure out how to do something useful with them! You might recall from the classical circuits module that classical bits can be modified to do useful stuff (as part of an *algorithm*) by using **logic gates** such as the AND, OR, NOT, and XOR gates that we played with when building the adder circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, there exist quantum gates that act on qubits. Unlike classical gates, quantum gates modify the qubit in ways that are reversible: that is, applying the same gate to the qubit twice will return it to its original state. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we represent qubit states like vectors in a cartesian plane, we can visualize the gates as *transformations* that are applied to these vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the most important quantum gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The X gate behaves exactly like a classical NOT gate. That is, it transforms the state $|0\\rangle$ into $|1\\rangle$ and the state $|1\\rangle$  into $|0\\rangle$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualise this as a transformation (let's treat it like a mystery box 'M') that maps the (1,0) vector to (0,1) and vice versa:\n",

    "<img src = \"images/shift.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this transformation like so: $X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle $ and $X|1\\rangle= |0\\rangle$. What happens if we apply the X gate to the state $|0\\rangle$ twice? We get the $|0\\rangle$ state right back! While this is also true of the classical NOT gate, it is important to note that *all* quantum gates are reversible. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the result of the X gate operation on a starting state of 0 will look like:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Is the classical XOR* gate reversible? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The H gate will create a superposition state when applied to the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states: it maps the $|0\\rangle$ state to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$ and the $|1\\rangle$ state to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be visualized as follows: \n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the result of the H gate operation on 0 and 1, respectively, will look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "<img src = \"images/plus.PNG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- What happens when the H gate is applied to $(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Z gate is a bit trickier. It does nothing when applied to the $|0\\rangle$ state, but will \"shift\" the $|1\\rangle$ state so that it becomes -$|1\\rangle$. You can see the effect of this on a superposition state, such as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle + |1 \\rangle)$. If you apply the Z gate to this, you will get $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle - |1 \\rangle)$. This shift becomes evident on the Bloch sphere:\n",
